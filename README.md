# libvote

A library of traits that enables easy swapping of voting algorithms.

Some other crates exist but either lack the ranked pairs algorithm or the ability to accumulate ballots asynchronously.

# Current state

Only ballot box types are implemented. The actual voting algorithms are not done.
